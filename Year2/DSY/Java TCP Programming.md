### Java TCP API
- `ServerSocket` represents a server TCP socket
	- bound to a particular port 
	- waiting to accept connecton requests from client sockets
- `Socket` represents one end of a TCP connection
	- Explicitly created by a client with a specified sever IP address and port number 
	- returned from `accept` in server
	- can be queried for local and reote addresses and port numbers 
	- has na `java.io.InputStream` to receive bytes from and a `java.io.OutputStream` to send bytes to

### TCP Client 
``` Java
import java.net.*;  
import java.io.*;  
public class TCPClient {  
	public static void main (String args[]) {  
		// arguments supply message and hostname of destination  
		Socket s = null;  
		try{  
			int serverPort = 7896;  
			s = new Socket(args[1], serverPort);  
			DataInputStream in = new DataInputStream( s.getInputStream() );  
			DataOutputStream out =  
			new DataOutputStream( s.getOutputStream() );  
			out.writeUTF(args[0]); // see encoding and representation  
			String data = in.readUTF();  
			System.out.println("Received: "+ data) ;  
		} catch (UnknownHostException e) {  
		System.out.println("Sock:"+e.getMessage());  
		} catch (EOFException e) {System.out.println("EOF:"+e.getMessage());  
		} catch (IOException e) {System.out.println("IO:"+e.getMessage());  
		} finally {if(s!=null) try {s.close();} catch (IOException e)  
		{System.out.println("close:"+e.getMessage());}}  
	}  
}
```
1. Make a Socket -> connect  
(Unknown host / IO exception -> problem)  
2. (Prepare input stream = from server)  
3. (Prepare output stream = to server)  
4. Write request bytes to output stream  
5. Read response bytes from input stream  (EOF -> not enough input)  
6. ...  
7. Close socket -> terminate connection

### TCP Server 

1. Make a ServerSocket with known port  
2. (repeatedly...)  
3. .accept a new client connection   represented by a new Socket  
4. . ... (make a thread to handle that client
```Java
import java.net.*;  
import java.io.*;  
public class TCPServer {  
	public static void main (String args[]) {  
	try{  
	int serverPort = 7896;  
	ServerSocket listenSocket = new ServerSocket(serverPort);  
	while(true) {  
	Socket clientSocket = listenSocket.accept();  
	Connection c = new Connection(clientSocket);  
	}  
	} catch(IOException e) {System.out.println("Listen :"+e.getMessage());}  
	}  
}
```

One instance per client:  
1. (Prepare input stream = from client)  
2. (Prepare output stream = to client)  
3. (start client-specific thread)  
4. Read request bytes from input stream  
5. ...  
6. Write response bytes to output stream  
7. (EOF -> not enough input)  
8. Close socket -> terminate connection  
9. (terminate thread)

```Java
class Connection extends Thread {  
	DataInputStream in;  
	DataOutputStream out;  
	Socket clientSocket;  
	public Connection (Socket aClientSocket) {  
		try {  
			clientSocket = aClientSocket;  
			in = new DataInputStream( clientSocket.getInputStream() );  
			out =new DataOutputStream( clientSocket.getOutputStream() );  
			this.start();  
		} catch(IOException e){
			System.out.println("Connection:"+e.getMessage());}  
	}  
	public void run(){  
		try { // an echo server  
			String data = in.readUTF();  
			out.writeUTF(data);  
		} catch(EOFException e) {System.out.println("EOF:"+e.getMessage());  
		} catch(IOException e) {System.out.println("IO:"+e.getMessage());  
		} finally{ try {clientSocket.close();}catch (IOException e){/*close failed*/}}  
	}  
}
```
### TCP Considerations 
- **Message Size**  - application reads / writes any number of bytes at a time until the connection is closed 
	- App does not see any message boundaries
	- needs to communicated any message boundaries explicitly in the bytes sent 
- **Message destinations** - a server can accept connection requests from any client 
	- once the connection is esablished then bytes are communicated only between that pair of processes 
- **blocking** - a limited amount of data is buffered at sender and receiver sockets and sends will **block** once the sender buffer is full
	- **flow control** 
	- connecting to a sever
	- acception a connection 
	- and reading from a socket normally block
- **Failure model** - COmmunication is reliable short of complete connection failure
	- lost messages are automatically retransmitted
	- duplicate packets are discarded and out of order packets are re-ordered
	- if a loss is not resolved within a time limit
		- connection fails

### Summary

- **TCP** proved a reliable connection oriented bidirectional byte based stream service
	- persistent network packet losses result in the connection failing 
	- blocking connect accept and receieve 
	- for almost any application transfering data reliably and or in significant amounts
		- HTTP, SSH, FTP, SMTP
-
