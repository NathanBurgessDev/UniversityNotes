## Secuirty Model 

- Security of a dsitributed system can be achieved by **security** the **processes** and the **channels** used for their interacts and by **protecting** the **objects** that they encapsulate against unautherorized access

### Protecting Objects 

- A **server** manages a collection of **objects**
	- on behalf of some users 
- Users run **client** programs which send **invocation** requests to the server to perform operations on the objects 
- **access rights** - specify who is allowed to perform teh operation s of a object 
- Each request is associated with a **principle** - the authority on which it is issued

- The **server** is responsible for
	- encofrcing access rights of each object
	- verifying the identify of the pronciple behind each request
- The **client** may
	- check the identify of the principle behind the server 
	- to ensure that the result comes from the required server 

### Securing processes and communication 

- Need to secure the processes themselves
	- protceted from direct interference from other processes on that machine
- Processes also interact by sending messages
	- messages are exposed to attack on the network
	- Server and eer processes expose their interfaces exposing them to attack from other processes 


###  Network Threat model
- To model network security threats we postulate an enemy 
	- Capable of sending any message to any process
	- reading or copying any message sent between a pair of processes
