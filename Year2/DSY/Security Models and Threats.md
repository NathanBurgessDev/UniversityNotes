## Secuirty Model 

- Security of a dsitributed system can be achieved by **security** the **processes** and the **channels** used for their interacts and by **protecting** the **objects** that they encapsulate against unautherorized access

### Protecting Objects 

- A **server** manages a collection of **objects**
	- on behalf of some users 
- Users run **client** programs which send **invocation** requests to the server to perform operations on the objects
