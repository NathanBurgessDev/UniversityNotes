### DNS name spaces

- Names in DNS are called **domain names**
- Name space is **hierarchical** 
	- **name components** or **labels**
	- delimiters i.e. "."
- **Absolute** not relative 
	- However - default domains are often configured to try as a possible suffix for unqualified names
- Attributes are encoded as **resource records** of various types or various purposes 

### DNS Applications
- **Host name resolution** - mapping a domain name to an IP address
	- DNS A (IPv4) and AAAA ()
