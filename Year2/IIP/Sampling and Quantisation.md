## Sampling 
- Digitisation of the *spatial coordinates*
- Determines *spatial resolution*

### Nyquist Rate 
- Samples mustb e taken at a rate which is
	- twice the frequency of the highest frequency component to be reconstructed
- Under sampling 
	- sampling at a rate that is too coarse
	- i.e. below the Nyquist rate 
- Aliasing
	- artefacts that result from under sampling 

### Aliasing 
- Occurs when two signals become indistinguishable when sampled
- In our case the two signals are the true image (the image that would be seen if there were no quantisation) and the one reconstructed by t


### Quantisation
- Digitisation of the *light intensity function*
- Determines *grey level, colour or radiometic resolution*
