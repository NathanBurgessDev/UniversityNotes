## Alternative Colour Spaces 

- RGB is OK but there are other general and application specifc colour spaces 
- If you want to work with plants you mught just use G for 'greenness'
	- G - (R + B) / 2 

### HSV
- based on colour rather than light
	- **Hue** what general colour is it
	- **Saturation** how stringly coloured is it
	- **Value** how bright or dark is it

### Hue, Saturation and Skin

- We dont always need all 3 colour values
- Human skin is tightly clustered in HS space

### Key Points
- Colir values are often interpolated
	- cant assume they are 100% reliable
- Colour space transformation is an example of a **point process** alterantive 3D colour spaces exist
- Not all applications require all 3 colour planes to be considered
