### Anisotropic Diffusion 

- Median filtering is good given small regions of speckle noise
	- less good if edges are important
- There are edge preserving operations 

- **Diffusion**
	- spreading out
	- mean and gaussian filters can be seen as diffusion processes
- **Anisotripic**
	- not the same in all directions 
- **The Basic idea**
	- Mean and Gaussian filters make each pixel more like its neighbours 
	- Anistropic diffusion makes each pixel more like th
