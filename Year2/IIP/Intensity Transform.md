### Linear Transforms
- Multiplication by and addition of a constant 
- $g(x,y) = a.f(x,y) + b$
- Where:
	- a - the *gain*, controls contrast
	- b - the *bias*, controls brightness

### Gain

### Bias

### Negation

- Often used to make fine details more visable

### Dynamic Range 
- Digital images are sampled 
	- contain a fixed number of data values
- Digital image representations can only store a fixed number of values
- Itensity transforms can produce values that are
	- outside that range so cant be stroed
	- clustered in a small part of that range and so are hard to distinguish
- Some intensity transforms need data in a particular range 

### Contrast Stretching 
- To convert a source image in which intensities range from min to max to one in which they range from min to max

### Non-linear Transforms 
- Thresholding

### Gamma Correction 

- When an image is displayed on a screen the hardware used effectively applies an intensity transform 
- You send a voltage proportional to the intesnity of a pixel, the screen displays an intensity that is related to that but now how you may think
